# Frontend (Feature-Sliced Design)

The browser frontend (`apps/web`) is a React + TypeScript + Vite PWA organized
with Feature-Sliced Design v2.1. The dependency-free WeChat shell
(`apps/miniapp`) authenticates natively and hosts that same responsive PWA in a
WebView. Reference:
[../reference/frontend-sources.md](../reference/frontend-sources.md).

## Layers

`app` -> `pages` -> `widgets` -> `features` -> `entities` -> `shared`.
Imports go only downward. Details in [layers.md](layers.md).

## Pages First

Prototype-specific logic stays in the page (`pages/travel-planner`,
`pages/trips`) with page-private widgets. Only genuinely reusable code
(UI primitives, API client, map wrapper, formatters, i18n) lives in `shared`.

## Unauthenticated routing

Signed-out web visitors land on the marketing page (`pages/landing`) at the
root; the auth form lives at `/signin`. Deep links (e.g. a shared trip) route
straight to sign-in so the target path survives login, and embedded WeChat
sessions skip the landing entirely. The gate lives in `app/App.tsx`. Landing
copy is centralized in the `landing` i18n namespace (EN + 中文) and its
screenshots reuse the README captures under `pages/landing/assets`.

## Error pages

`pages/error` is one variant-driven surface for every error state — `404`,
`500`, `403`, `503` and `offline` — so the whole family shares layout, motion
and actions. `ErrorPage` takes a `variant`; copy lives in the `error` i18n
namespace (EN + 中文) and imagery is pulled at random from a per-variant pool of
Unsplash CDN photos (alt text only — nothing overlaid on the image). Every
action maps to a real destination (`home`, `signIn`, `retry`) — no dead-end
buttons. The gate in `app/App.tsx` renders the `404` surface for unrecognized
paths (`isKnownPath` in `app/router.tsx`), and `app/AppErrorBoundary.tsx`
catches render-time crashes and shows the `500` surface with a working
"Try again".

## Known routes

`isKnownPath` (in `app/router.tsx`) is the single allow-list the gate consults
before rendering the `404` surface, so **every new client route must be
registered there** (with a regression test in `app/router.test.ts`). Current
routes:

- `/`, `/today`, `/journal` — the authenticated home hub surfaces owned by
  `pages/trips` (Trips grid, Today, Travelogues). Grouped as `HUB_PATHS`.
- `/journal/:entryId` — travelogue reader (`matchJournalEntryId`).
- `/trips/:id` — the single-trip planner (`matchTripId`).
- `/invite/:token` — invite accept surface (`matchInviteToken`).
- `/signin`, `/miniapp` — auth form and the WeChat embedded entry.

In the WeChat shell the hub surfaces share one native page: switching between
`HUB_PATHS` (or leaving a travelogue reader) stays in the current WebView via
SPA history, and only returning to the hub from a deeper native page (e.g. a
trip) resets the native stack. See [miniapp.md](miniapp.md).

## Path aliases

`@/*` maps to `apps/web/src/*` (see `apps/web/tsconfig.json` and
`apps/web/vite.config.ts`). Import primitives as `@/shared/ui/button`, the map
as `@/shared/ui/map`, etc.

## Public API

Each slice exposes an `index.ts`. Import the slice, never its internals:

```ts
// good
import { Button } from "@/shared/ui/button";
// bad
import { Button } from "@/shared/ui/button/button";
```

## Where does code go?

| Kind | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Providers, router, global styles | `app/` |
| A route/screen composition | `pages/<name>/` |
| Reused composite block | `widgets/<name>/` |
| Reusable user scenario | `features/<name>/` |
| Reusable domain data/rules | `entities/<name>/` |
| UI primitives, api client, map, i18n, utils | `shared/` |
